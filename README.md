# cv_project_bonefracture_detection
"A deep learning-based computer vision system for detecting bone fractures in X-ray images using ResNet50 architecture.

This project presents a **deep learning-powered solution** for automated **bone fracture detection** in X-ray images. It leverages the **ResNet50 convolutional neural network architecture**, fine-tuned on medical imaging datasets to classify whether a bone is fractured or not. The system can be deployed using **Flask** for real-time predictions through a simple web interface.

 Key Features

- 📷 X-ray image classification using **ResNet50**
- 🧠 Fine-tuned deep CNN with binary output (fractured / not fractured)
- 📊 Performance-enhanced via callbacks and learning rate schedulers
- ⚙️ Real-time predictions served via **Flask**
- 💾 Model saving with `.keras` format
